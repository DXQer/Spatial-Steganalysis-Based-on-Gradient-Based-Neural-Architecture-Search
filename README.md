# Spatial-Steganalysis-Based-on-Gradient-Based-Neural-Architecture-Search

## Introduction
The implement is to introduce a gradient-based network architecture search method called PC-DARTS into steganalysis.
This code is based on the implementation of [PC-DARTS](https://github.com/yuhuixu1993/PC-DARTS) and [MPNCOV](https://github.com/jiangtaoxie/fast-MPN-COV).
